# Todo List App

This app is a simple todo list application written in Node.js. It uses the inquirer library to prompt the user for input and stores the todos in an array.

## Usage

To use this app, simply run it with `node index.js` and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter a new todo item and then asked if you would like to add more items. When you are done, your list of todos will be printed out in the console.
